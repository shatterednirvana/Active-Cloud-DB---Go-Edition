Active Cloud DB - Go Edition!

Active Cloud DB provides a REST interface to the Google App Engine Datastore
API. That means that you can write a client that uses good old REST and
automatically get access to anything that talks Datastore, whether it be
Google App Engine and its scalable platform or AppScale and the plethora
of different databases it supports.

A Python version of this already exists, so this project is really more of an
experiment to learn Go better and get some experience with Bootstrap. Speaking
of which, there's a live demo of this application hosted on App Engine at
http://active-cloud-db-go.appspot.com - so go check it out!
